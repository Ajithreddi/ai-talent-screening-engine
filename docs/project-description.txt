AI Talent Screening Engine (AI-TSE)

AI Talent Screening Engine (AI-TSE) is an automated hiring assistant designed to streamline the resume screening and evaluation process for IT companies and HR teams.
The system accepts resumes through a Telegram bot, processes and extracts resume text, applies AI-driven screening through a Large Language Model (Gemini), and produces structured candidate evaluations including skills, experience, match scores, and final recommendations.

The workflow is built using n8n, a low-code automation tool, and integrates with:
